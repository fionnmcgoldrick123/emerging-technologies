These functions form the foundation of digital logic and computer circuits. For example, a simple Boolean function with one input might always return ``True``, or it might flip the input (returning ``False`` when given ``True``, and vice versa).\n",

    "### Approach & Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "The task requires creating a Python function that randomly generates either a constant or balanced Boolean function with four inputs. To solve this problem, I need to understand what data structure can represent such a function and how to ensure the randomness meets the mathematical requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will represent the Boolean function as a lookup table. Since there are four Boolean inputs, there are 2⁴ = 16 possible input combinations. Each combination can be represented as a tuple of four Boolean values, such as ``(True, False, True, False)``. The function will map each of these 16 tuples to either ``True`` or ``False``. I will use a [Python dictionary](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/) to store these mappings, where the keys are tuples representing input combinations and the values are the corresponding outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I need to randomly decide whether to generate a constant or balanced function. I will use Python's [``random`` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) to make this choice with equal probability. The ``random.choice()`` function provides a simple way to randomly select between these two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "For generating a constant function, the logic is straightforward. I will randomly select either ``True`` or ``False`` using ``random.choice([True, False])``, then assign this same value to all 16 possible input combinations. This ensures the function always returns the same output regardless of the input, satisfying the definition of a constant function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For generating a balanced function, I need to ensure exactly 8 of the 16 inputs return ``True`` and the other 8 return ``False``. To achieve this, I will first generate all 16 possible input combinations using [``itertools.product()``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product), which efficiently creates the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of Boolean values. Then, I will use ``random.sample()`` to randomly select exactly 8 of these combinations without replacement. These selected combinations will be assigned ``True``, while the remaining 8 will be assigned ``False``. This approach guarantees the balanced property while maintaining randomness in which specific inputs return which values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, my function will return a Python function (using a [lambda or def statement](https://realpython.com/python-lambda/)) that takes four Boolean arguments and looks up the result in the dictionary. This creates a callable function object that can be tested and used in subsequent problems."

    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates the core ideas behind the [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1992.0167) by building the classical functions that quantum computers can analyze more efficiently. Working through this problem reveals several key insights about Boolean functions and why quantum computing offers genuine advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Boolean Function Universe**: When dealing with four Boolean inputs, we're exploring a space containing 2^16 = 65,536 different possible Boolean functions. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, however, only cares about a small fraction of these: exactly 2 constant functions plus C(16,8) = 12,870 balanced functions. This represents less than 20% of all possible functions, which shows us that the algorithm addresses a very specific mathematical problem rather than analyzing arbitrary functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This restriction connects to broader work in [computational complexity theory](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533379/). As [Sipser (2012)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262018302/) explains in his foundational text on computation theory, many important algorithms work by restricting the problem space to make solutions tractable. The Deutsch-Jozsa approach exemplifies this principle by focusing on function classes with special mathematical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomness in Algorithm Testing**: Using Python's `random` module ensures we generate constant and balanced functions with equal probability. This uniform distribution matters for fair algorithm testing since biased samples could make one algorithm appear better than another. The [pseudorandom generation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) works fine for our demonstration, though [Knuth (1997)](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html) notes in *The Art of Computer Programming* that true randomness would require quantum or hardware sources for formal analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Storage Trade-offs**: Representing Boolean functions as lookup tables gives us instant O(1) access time but costs us O(2^n) storage space. With four inputs, storing 16 key-value pairs feels manageable, but this approach quickly breaks down. [Savage (1998)](https://www.elsevier.com/books/models-of-computation/savage/978-0-12-619851-0) discusses these exponential blowups in his models of computation text, showing why classical storage of Boolean functions becomes impossible as input size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical Verification Costs**: Our test functions check all possible inputs to verify whether a function is constant or balanced. This exhaustive approach guarantees correctness but shows exactly why classical computation struggles here. As [Nielsen & Chuang (2010)](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6802309D06B22D27D) demonstrate in their quantum computing textbook, verifying balanced functions classically requires evaluating up to half the inputs plus one more in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum Speedup Context**: This classical implementation helps us understand why the [quantum version](https://quantum.country/qcvc) provides such dramatic improvement. Classical computers need up to 2^(n-1) + 1 function calls to distinguish constant from balanced functions (9 calls for 4 inputs), but quantum computers need just one oracle call regardless of input size. [Bernstein & Vazirani (1997)](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0097539796300921) showed that this exponential separation between classical and quantum query complexity extends to many similar problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Objects and Abstraction**: The returned function object bundles lookup behavior with metadata about function type. This design pattern shows how Python's support for functions as first-class objects enables clean abstractions. [Abelson & Sussman (1996)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262510875/) explore these abstraction techniques extensively in *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, showing how treating functions as data enables powerful programming techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundations**: The code directly implements the formal definitions from Boolean algebra. Constant functions satisfy f(x₁,x₂,x₃,x₄) = c for some fixed constant c, while balanced functions satisfy |{x: f(x) = True}| = 2^(n-1). These definitions come from [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function) and connect to [Rosen's (2019)](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/discrete-mathematics-applications-rosen/M9781259676512.html) treatment of Boolean functions in his discrete math textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem bridges abstract mathematical concepts with practical quantum algorithm development. It shows how classical computational limits drive the search for quantum solutions, connecting to the broader narrative of quantum computing research described by [Preskill (2018)](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2018-08-06-79/) in his analysis of quantum computing in the current era."

    "\n",
    "**Question:** [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm) is designed to demonstrate a [potential advantage of quantum computing](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/) over classical computation. To understand this advantage, we must first understand the classical cost of solving the underlying problem. Write a Python function ``determine_constant_balanced`` that takes as input a function ``f``, as defined in Problem 1. The function should analyze ``f`` and return the string ``\"constant\"`` or ``\"balanced\"`` depending on whether the function is constant or balanced. Write a brief note on the efficiency of your solution. What is the maximum number of times you need to call ``f`` to be 100% certain whether it is constant or balanced?"

    "### Background & Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of determining whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced sits at the heart of understanding [quantum computational advantage](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5). Before we can appreciate what quantum computers offer, we need to understand how classical computers tackle this classification problem and why it proves fundamentally difficult for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Classical Decision Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Boolean function with n inputs, we want to determine its type with absolute certainty. For our four-input functions from Problem 1, there are 2⁴ = 16 possible input combinations. A [constant function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_function) returns the same value for all 16 inputs, while a [balanced function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function) returns ``True`` for exactly 8 inputs and ``False`` for the other 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of the Classical Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Testing if a function is constant or balanced\n",
    "def example_test(f):\n",
    "    first_output = f(False, False, False, False)\n",
    "    second_output = f(False, False, False, True)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if first_output != second_output:\n",
    "        print(\"Function is balanced (different outputs found)\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Need more tests to be certain...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# The problem: finding different outputs proves balanced,\n",
    "# but proving constant requires testing many inputs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worst-Case Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that proving a function is balanced requires finding two inputs that give different outputs, which could happen on the second function call. However, proving a function is constant requires confirming that every possible input returns the same value. In the [worst case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worst-case_complexity), a classical algorithm must evaluate the function at more than half of all possible inputs before it can be certain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For n Boolean inputs:\n",
    "- **Best case**: 2 function calls (find two different outputs immediately)\n",
    "- **Worst case**: 2^(n-1) + 1 function calls (check more than half the inputs)\n",
    "- **For 4 inputs**: Maximum of 9 function calls needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem illustrates a fundamental limitation of classical computation. As [Cleve et al. (1998)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1998.0164) demonstrated, classical computers face an inherent lower bound on query complexity for this decision problem. No clever algorithm or optimization can reduce the worst-case number of queries below 2^(n-1) + 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm) revolutionized our understanding by showing that a quantum computer can solve this same problem with just one function evaluation, regardless of the number of inputs. This represents an exponential speedup: as n grows, classical computers need exponentially more queries while quantum computers need exactly one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Black-Box Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem uses the [oracle model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine) (also called black-box model), where we can only learn about the function by querying it with specific inputs. We cannot inspect its internal structure or implementation. This model allows fair comparison between classical and quantum algorithms since both receive the function as an opaque oracle. As [de Wolf (2019)](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf) explains in his quantum computing lecture notes, query complexity provides a clean framework for demonstrating quantum advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection to Problem 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions generated in Problem 1 serve as perfect test cases for this classical testing algorithm. By constructing functions where we know the ground truth (constant or balanced), we can verify that our classical testing algorithm correctly identifies function types before comparing its performance to quantum approaches in later problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this classical baseline is essential. The effort required to solve this problem classically makes the single-query quantum solution all the more remarkable, demonstrating that [quantum parallelism and interference](https://quantum.country/qcvc) can provide genuine computational advantages over classical approaches."

    "### Approach and Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced, I need to test it systematically until I can make a definitive conclusion. Here's my strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Basic Logic:**\n",
    "- If I find two inputs that produce different outputs, the function must be balanced\n",
    "- If all inputs I test produce the same output, it might be constant (but I need to test enough to be sure)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate all possible inputs**: For a 4-input Boolean function, create all 16 possible combinations: (False, False, False, False), (False, False, False, True), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test inputs one by one**: Call the function with each input and record the output\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Look for differences**: As soon as I find two different outputs, I know it's balanced and can stop testing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle the worst case**: If all outputs are the same, I need to test more than half the inputs to be certain it's constant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "- **For balanced functions**: I'll find different outputs quickly (within the first 9 tests at worst)\n",
    "- **For constant functions**: All outputs will be identical, and I need to test at least 9 inputs to be 100% certain\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Math Behind It:**\n",
    "With 4 inputs, there are 16 total combinations. A balanced function returns `True` for exactly 8 inputs and `False` for 8 inputs. In the worst case scenario, I might test all 8 inputs that return the same value before finding one that returns a different value. So I need at most 8 + 1 = 9 function calls to be completely certain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is simple but effective - it's the best any classical computer can do for this problem. The [quantum version](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/deutsch-jozsa-algorithm) can solve it with just one function call, which shows the power of quantum computing."

    "### Results and Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "The test suite confirms that our `determine_constant_balanced` function works correctly. The specific test cases verify that hand-crafted constant functions (always-True and always-False) are correctly identified, as well as balanced functions like the first-input function and XOR-all function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comprehensive random testing shows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **100% Accuracy**: All randomly generated functions are correctly classified as either constant or balanced\n",
    "2. **Efficiency Guarantee**: The algorithm never requires more than 9 function calls, confirming our worst-case analysis\n",
    "3. **Early Termination**: For balanced functions, the algorithm often finds differing outputs within just 2-3 calls, demonstrating efficient early stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of function calls needed reveals an important pattern. Constant functions consistently require 9 calls (since we must test more than half the inputs to be certain), while balanced functions typically require far fewer calls because finding two different outputs proves the function is balanced immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates the fundamental asymmetry in the classical approach: proving a function is balanced is easy (find any two different outputs), but proving it's constant requires exhaustive testing of more than half the input space."

    "### Interpretation and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "This classical testing function reveals the fundamental challenge that motivated [Deutsch and Jozsa's quantum algorithm](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1992.0167). By implementing the straightforward classical approach, we can see exactly where classical computation struggles and why quantum methods offer a real advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Asymmetry Problem**: Our algorithm treats constant and balanced functions very differently. Finding that a function is balanced can happen quickly because we just need any two inputs that give different outputs. But proving a function is constant requires us to keep testing until we have checked more than half of all possible inputs. This asymmetry means that constant functions always require the maximum number of queries, while balanced functions usually finish much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon connects to fundamental ideas in [computational complexity](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262018302/). Verifying a property (balanced) through counterexample is often easier than proving a universal property (constant) holds everywhere. [Arora and Barak (2009)](https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/) discuss this distinction in their computational complexity textbook, noting that existential proofs differ fundamentally from universal ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query Complexity and Information Theory**: The number of function calls our algorithm makes relates to [query complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_complexity), which measures how many times we must ask about a function to learn something about it. For the constant vs balanced decision problem, [classical query complexity](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf) has a proven lower bound of 2^(n-1) + 1 queries in the worst case. This is not a limitation of our particular algorithm but rather a fundamental limit that applies to any classical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "[de Wolf (2019)](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf) explains in his quantum computing lecture notes that this lower bound comes from information theory. A classical algorithm can only learn one bit of information per function call, and distinguishing between 2 + C(16,8) = 12,872 possible functions requires enough queries to rule out all but one possibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Early Termination Strategy**: Our implementation uses a smart stopping rule. As soon as we see two different output values, we know the function is balanced and stop testing. This optimization dramatically improves average case performance for balanced functions. The test results show that balanced functions often need only 2 or 3 calls to classify, while constant functions always need the full 9 calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "This connects to broader algorithmic principles. [Cormen et al. (2009)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/) describe similar early termination strategies in their algorithms textbook, noting that avoiding unnecessary work often matters more than optimizing individual operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Black Box Constraint**: Our approach treats the function as a [black box or oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine). We cannot look inside to see how it works; we can only test it with specific inputs and observe the outputs. This constraint is essential for fair comparison with quantum algorithms, since both classical and quantum methods receive the function in the same opaque way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle model also matches many real world scenarios. When testing software, we often cannot access source code. When probing physical systems, we can only measure responses to inputs. [Sipser (2012)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262018302/) discusses how oracle complexity provides insights into fundamental computational limits independent of implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Observations**: Running many tests reveals interesting patterns. Constant functions form a smaller portion of the function space (only 2 out of 12,872 possible functions), so when testing random functions, we rarely see constant ones. However, our random generator produces them with 50% probability by design, giving us a balanced test suite. This design choice ensures we thoroughly test both branches of our classification algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection to Quantum Advantage**: The [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) solves this exact problem with just one function call. This exponential speedup from 2^(n-1) + 1 calls down to 1 call represents one of the earliest proven [quantum computational advantages](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5). While the problem itself has limited practical applications, it demonstrates that quantum computers can extract global information about functions more efficiently than any classical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nielsen and Chuang explain in their textbook *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* (2010) that this speedup comes from [quantum parallelism and interference](https://quantum.country/qcvc). A quantum computer evaluates the function on a superposition of all inputs simultaneously, then uses interference to extract the global constant or balanced property without needing to look at individual outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implications**: Although the constant vs balanced problem is artificial, the underlying computational pattern appears in many useful applications. Quantum algorithms for [period finding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm), [database search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm), and [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optimization_algorithms) all exploit similar ideas about extracting global properties from functions efficiently."

    "\n",
    "The `determine_constant_balanced()` function has different time costs depending on the function type it receives:\n",
    "\n",
    "For constant functions:\n",
    "- We must make exactly 2^(n-1) + 1 = 9 function calls to be certain\n",
    "- Generating all input combinations takes O(2^n) time\n",
    "- Each function call runs in O(1) time assuming the function uses a lookup table\n",
    "- Total: O(2^n) time, which equals O(16) = O(1) for our four input case\n",
    "\n",
    "For balanced functions:\n",
    "- Best case: 2 function calls (first two inputs give different outputs)\n",
    "- Worst case: 9 function calls (first 8 inputs happen to all give the same output)\n",
    "- Average case: roughly O(1) calls since we usually find differences quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight here is that the worst case always involves 9 calls regardless of function type. [Beals et al. (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1145/502090.502097) proved in their quantum query complexity paper that this 2^(n-1) + 1 bound is tight for any deterministic classical algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm uses minimal extra space:\n",
    "- The set `outputs_seen` stores at most 2 Boolean values: O(1) space\n",
    "- The counter variable `calls_made` uses O(1) space  \n",
    "- The list of all inputs from `itertools.product()` takes O(2^n) space\n",
    "\n",
    "Total space complexity is O(2^n) = O(16) for four inputs. Most of this comes from materializing the full list of inputs, though we could reduce this to O(1) by generating inputs on demand instead of storing them all upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maximum Function Calls Needed**\n",
    "\n",
    "For 100% certainty about the function type, we need at most **9 function calls** with four Boolean inputs. Here is why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are 16 possible inputs total\n",
    "2. A balanced function returns True for exactly 8 inputs and False for 8 inputs\n",
    "3. In the absolute worst case, we might test all 8 inputs that give the same output before finding one that gives a different output\n",
    "4. After testing 8 inputs with identical outputs, the 9th input will either:\n",
    "   - Give a different output (proving the function is balanced), or\n",
    "   - Give the same output (but now we have tested more than half, so it must be constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "This 2^(n-1) + 1 formula generalizes to any number of inputs:\n",
    "- 1 input: 2 calls maximum\n",
    "- 2 inputs: 3 calls maximum  \n",
    "- 4 inputs: 9 calls maximum\n",
    "- 8 inputs: 129 calls maximum\n",
    "- 20 inputs: 524,289 calls maximum\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential growth explains why this problem becomes intractable classically for large inputs, while the [quantum solution](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) always needs just one call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of Our Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several constraints affect when and how well this algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed to Four Inputs**: The current implementation only handles functions with exactly four Boolean inputs. Generalizing to arbitrary input sizes would require changing how we generate input combinations and calculate the stopping threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Requires Honest Functions**: We assume the input function is genuinely constant or balanced. If someone provides a function that is neither (returns True for 7 inputs and False for 9 inputs, for example), our algorithm might misclassify it. Adding validation would require testing all inputs, eliminating any efficiency gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assumes Deterministic Functions**: The algorithm expects the function to return the same output every time for a given input. If the function behaves randomly or has side effects that change its outputs, our classification becomes meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Parallelization**: We test inputs one at a time in sequence. While we could theoretically test multiple inputs in parallel, we would still need to wait for at least half the tests to complete before making a decision. Classical parallelism cannot beat the fundamental query complexity bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison with Random Guessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting baseline is random guessing. Since constant functions are extremely rare (only 2 out of 12,872 in our problem space), always guessing \"balanced\" would be right about 99.98% of the time for randomly chosen functions. However, this fails to provide the 100% certainty guarantee that our algorithm delivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Montanaro (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1038/npjqi.2015.23) discusses how query complexity differs from decision accuracy in his survey of quantum algorithms. Having guaranteed correctness matters in applications where wrong answers are costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where Classical Testing Succeeds**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its limitations, the classical approach works well when:\n",
    "- The number of inputs is small (under 10 or so)\n",
    "- We need a simple, understandable algorithm for teaching purposes\n",
    "- We want to verify results from quantum simulations\n",
    "- We lack access to quantum hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "For educational purposes, implementing the classical solution first helps students appreciate exactly what quantum algorithms improve upon. Our test suite demonstrates this by showing the stark difference between the 9 calls needed classically versus the single quantum query."

    "**Question:** [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm) is the simplest example of a [quantum algorithm](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/group-theory) using [superposition](https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-superposition) to determine a [global property](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/qt-entangle/#5) of a function with a single evaluation. In the single-input case, there are four possible Boolean functions. Using Qiskit, create the appropriate [quantum oracles](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/4625/what-exactly-is-an-oracle/4626#4626) for each of the possible single-Boolean-input functions used in Deutsch's algorithm. Demonstrate their use and explain how each oracle implements its corresponding function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background & Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Multi-Input to Single-Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Problems 1 and 2 dealt with four-input Boolean functions, [Deutsch's original 1985 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch) actually works with the simpler case of **single-input** functions. With just one Boolean input, there are only four possible Boolean functions:\n",

    "| f₃ | 1 | 1 | Constant | Always returns 1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, determining if one of these functions is constant or balanced requires **two queries** (test both f(0) and f(1)). Deutsch's algorithm achieves this with **one query** by using quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Makes Quantum Oracles Different**\n",
    "\n",
    "A [quantum oracle](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/4625/what-exactly-is-an-oracle/4626#4626) is not just a function call-it's a **unitary transformation** that modifies quantum states. Unlike classical functions that destroy the input and produce an output, quantum operations must be [reversible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing) to preserve information.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Preserves reversibility**: We can't \"uncompute\" a simple output without keeping the input\n",
    "2. **Enables phase kickback**: When used in Deutsch's algorithm, the output qubit's state affects the input qubit's phase-this is how the algorithm extracts global information\n",

    "### Results and Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation successfully created quantum oracles for all four single-input Boolean functions. Each oracle was tested against all possible input states and verified to work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Oracle Behavior Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "All four oracles correctly implement the transformation |x⟩|y⟩ -> |x⟩|y ⊕ f(x)⟩, where:\n",
    "- The input qubit (qubit 0) is always preserved\n",
    "- The output qubit (qubit 1) is modified by XORing with f(x)\n",
    "- Each oracle is [reversible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing) - applying it twice returns the original state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constant Functions (f₀ and f₃)**: Both constant oracles behave independently of the input value. For f₀, the output never changes since XORing with 0 has no effect. For f₃, the output always flips because XORing with 1 is equivalent to applying NOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Balanced Functions (f₁ and f₂)**: These oracles produce different outputs depending on the input. The [CNOT gate](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/utility-scale-quantum-computing/bits-gates-and-circuits#cnot-gate) creates this input-dependent behavior by using controlled operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gate Efficiency**: The simplest oracle (f₀) requires no gates at all, while the most complex (f₂) needs three gates. This shows how [quantum circuit design](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/3943/why-is-the-quantum-not-gate-not-sufficient-for-universal-quantum-computation) can vary in complexity even for similar logical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reversibility Verified**: All oracles passed the double-application test. This confirms they are [unitary operations](https://quantum.ibm.com/learning/course/basics-of-quantum-information/single-qubit-gates/quantum-gates), a fundamental requirement for quantum computing operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Demonstration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing input state |10⟩ (x=1, y=0) on each oracle:\n",
    "- **f₀**: |10⟩ -> |10⟩ (no change, since f(1)=0)\n",
    "- **f₁**: |10⟩ -> |11⟩ (output flips, since f(1)=1)  \n",
    "- **f₂**: |10⟩ -> |10⟩ (no change, since f(1)=0)\n",
    "- **f₃**: |10⟩ -> |11⟩ (output flips, since f(1)=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how the oracles encode their function's truth table into quantum operations. The XOR structure ensures the transformation is reversible while still computing the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Quantum Oracles Matter**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum oracles are the building blocks that connect classical problems to quantum algorithms. Unlike classical function calls that simply return an output, quantum oracles manipulate superposition states while preserving quantum information. This property is what enables [Deutsch's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm) to solve problems faster than classical approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that these oracles work on multiple possible inputs simultaneously when fed qubits in superposition. This [quantum parallelism](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/6/what-is-quantum-parallelism) is what gives quantum algorithms their power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Patterns Observed**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The XOR Trick**: Using |y ⊕ f(x)⟩ instead of just |f(x)⟩ is not arbitrary - it's the only way to make the operation reversible. Direct computation would destroy information, violating the [unitarity requirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_operator) of quantum mechanics. This technique is used throughout quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Control Inversion**: The f₂ oracle demonstrates a clever trick - wrapping a CNOT gate with X gates inverts when it fires. This pattern appears in many quantum circuits when you need to trigger operations on |0⟩ instead of |1⟩.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ancilla Qubits**: The output qubit acts as an [ancilla](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/6084/what-is-an-ancilla-qubit) - a helper qubit that assists computation. In Deutsch's algorithm, this ancilla will be prepared in a special state to extract global properties through [phase kickback](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/2382/what-is-the-intuition-behind-the-phase-kickback-technique).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical vs Quantum Function Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, determining if a single-input function is constant or balanced requires checking both f(0) and f(1) - that's two queries. But these quantum oracles enable Deutsch's algorithm to answer this question with just one query by exploiting [quantum interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference).\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle doesn't reveal whether the function is constant or balanced directly. Instead, it's used within a larger quantum circuit that creates interference patterns. When the input is in superposition, the oracle acts on all inputs simultaneously, and the subsequent gates extract global information through the way quantum states interfere with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations and Extensions**\n",
    "\n",
    "While these single-input oracles seem simple, they demonstrate principles that scale to larger problems:\n",
    "- The [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) extends this to n-bit functions\n",
    "- [Grover's algorithm](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html) uses oracles to mark solutions in search problems  \n",
    "- [Shor's algorithm](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/guide/shors-factoring-algorithm) uses oracles to implement modular arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge in practical quantum computing is that building oracles for complex functions requires many gates, leading to [decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence). Current [NISQ devices](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/nisq-algorithm) have limited circuit depth, so oracle efficiency matters greatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "These oracles prove that quantum computers can manipulate classical logic using reversible operations. This addresses a fundamental question in quantum computing: how do we perform irreversible classical computations on a reversible quantum system? The answer is [ancilla qubits and the XOR pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205095), which this problem demonstrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that we can test these oracles on [quantum simulators](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/providers_aer) like AerSimulator is itself remarkable - we're using classical computers to verify quantum operations before running them on real quantum hardware. This simulation capability is essential for developing and debugging quantum algorithms before deploying them on expensive and limited quantum processors."

(1995)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9503016) proved in their foundational paper on elementary quantum gates that at least two qubits are needed to implement any non-trivial function as a reversible oracle, since single-qubit operations can only negate or preserve one bit, not compute a function of a separate input.\n",

    "- **f₃**: A single X gate on the output qubit implements $y \\oplus 1 = \\overline{y}$, which is clearly minimal.\n",
    "- **f₂**: The X-CNOT-X pattern (3 gates) implements an anti-controlled NOT by negating the control qubit. This can be verified as optimal by noting that no single gate or two-gate sequence on 2 qubits can conditionally flip the target when the control is $|0\\rangle$ rather than $|1\\rangle$. [Shende, Markov & Bullock (2004)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308033) provide a comprehensive treatment of optimal two-qubit circuit synthesis, showing that any two-qubit unitary requires at most three CNOT gates in the general case.\n",

    "**Simulation Overhead**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation uses Qiskit's `AerSimulator` for verification. Simulating quantum circuits on a classical computer has significant overhead:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State vector simulation** requires $O(2^n)$ memory and $O(2^n)$ time per gate, where $n$ is the number of qubits. For our 2-qubit circuits, this is $O(4)$ - trivial.\n",
    "- **Shot-based simulation** (which we use with 1024 shots) adds a multiplicative factor. Each shot samples from the output distribution, so 1024 shots of a 2-qubit circuit run in constant time.\n",
    "- The simulation faithfully reproduces ideal quantum behavior but does **not model noise**, gate errors, or decoherence. [Coles et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3517340) address this gap in their *Quantum Algorithm Implementations for Beginners*, noting that simulator results represent the theoretical upper bound on algorithm performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these small circuits, simulation is instantaneous. However, [Aaronson & Arkhipov (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1145/1993636.1993682) proved that simulating even specific types of quantum circuits becomes classically intractable as qubit count grows, which is the fundamental basis for quantum computational advantage."

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Use [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) to design a [quantum circuit](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/quantum-circuits/introduction) that solves Deutsch's problem for a function with a single Boolean input. Implement the necessary circuit and demonstrate its use with each of the quantum oracles from Problem 3. Describe how the interference pattern produced by the circuit allows you to determine whether the function is constant or balanced using only one query to the oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Revolutionary Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1985, physicist [David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch) published a paper that would change how we think about computation. At the time, [quantum computing](https://www.quantum.gov/quantum-computing/) was purely theoretical. No one had built a quantum computer, and many doubted they ever could. Deutsch asked a simple question: *If we could build a quantum computer, would it actually be more powerful than a classical computer?*\n",
    "\n",
    "His answer came in the form of what we now call [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm). It wasn't designed to solve a practical problem. Instead, it was a **proof of concept**. It was a mathematical demonstration that quantum computers could, at least in principle, solve certain problems faster than any classical computer possibly could.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Classical Baseline**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine someone hands you a black box containing one of the four single input Boolean functions from Problem 3. You can query the box by feeding it inputs (0 or 1), and it gives you outputs. Your job is to figure out whether the function inside is constant (always returns the same value) or balanced (returns different values for different inputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classically, this requires two queries**:\n",
    "- First, you ask: What is f(0)?\n",
    "- Then, you ask: What is f(1)?\n",
    "- If both answers are the same, it's constant. If they differ, it's balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's simply no way around it. With classical computation, you must check both inputs to be 100% certain. This is what we demonstrated in Problem 2. The [query complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_complexity) lower bound forces you to make multiple function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Quantum Breakthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deutsch's algorithm solves this same problem with **just one query**. How is this possible? The answer lies in three fundamental quantum phenomena:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Superposition](https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-superposition)**: A quantum bit (qubit) can exist in a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states simultaneously. When we query the oracle, we can feed it both inputs at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[Quantum parallelism](https://quantum.country/qcvc)**: Because the oracle receives a superposition of inputs, it evaluates the function on all possible inputs simultaneously in a single operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **[Interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference)**: After the oracle runs, we use quantum gates to make the different computation paths interfere with each other like waves canceling out or reinforcing. This interference reveals global properties of the function without us ever knowing the individual outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Nielsen and Chuang explain in their textbook [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (2010)](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6AEFFEA52D53BE9AE#overview), this represents a fundamental difference between classical and quantum computation: \"Quantum algorithms can exploit interference to extract global information about a function while learning nothing about individual function values.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Circuit Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deutsch's algorithm uses a carefully choreographed sequence of quantum operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input qubits: |0⟩|1⟩\n",
    "      |\n",
    "   Hadamard  Hadamard  (Create superposition)\n",
    "      |\n",
    "   ┌──────────────┐\n",
    "   │    Oracle    │    (Query f(x) for all x simultaneously)\n",
    "   └──────────────┘\n",
    "      |         \n",
    "   Hadamard         (Recombine paths through interference)\n",
    "      |\n",
    "   Measure          (Read result: |0⟩ = constant, |1⟩ = balanced)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step by Step Quantum Magic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through what happens at each stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Initial State**: We start with two qubits in states |0⟩ and |1⟩\n",
    "   - The first qubit (input qubit) starts at |0⟩\n",
    "   - The second qubit (output qubit) starts at |1⟩\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Creating Superposition**: We apply [Hadamard gates](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/single-qubit-gates/common-gates) (H gates) to both qubits\n",
    "   - H transforms |0⟩ into (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2, an equal superposition\n",
    "   - H transforms |1⟩ into (|0⟩ - |1⟩)/√2, an equal superposition with opposite phase\n",
    "   - After this step, our input qubit exists in both |0⟩ and |1⟩ states at once\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Oracle Query**: We apply the oracle from Problem 3\n",
    "   - The oracle evaluates f(x) for **both** x=0 and x=1 simultaneously\n",
    "   - This is quantum parallelism in action. One operation, two evaluations\n",
    "   - The results get encoded in the [quantum phase](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/quantum-phase) (relative sign) of the superposition\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Interference**: We apply another Hadamard gate to the input qubit\n",
    "   - This causes the two computational paths (the x=0 path and x=1 path) to interfere\n",
    "   - If the function is **constant**, the paths interfere **constructively** (reinforce each other) and collapse to |0⟩\n",
    "   - If the function is **balanced**, the paths interfere **destructively** (cancel each other) and collapse to |1⟩\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Measurement**: We measure the input qubit\n",
    "   - If we get 0, the function is constant\n",
    "   - If we get 1, the function is balanced\n",
    "   - We made only **one** oracle call, yet we know the answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Why Interference Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a constant function where f(0) = f(1):\n",
    "- After the oracle, both the x=0 and x=1 computational paths carry the same phase\n",
    "- When we apply the final Hadamard gate, these paths add together (constructive interference)\n",
    "- The result points to the |0⟩ state\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a balanced function where f(0) ≠ f(1):\n",
    "- After the oracle, the x=0 and x=1 paths carry opposite phases\n",
    "- When we apply the final Hadamard gate, these paths subtract (destructive interference)  \n",
    "- The result points to the |1⟩ state\n",
    "\n",
    "As [Cleve et al. (1998)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1998.0164) describe it: \"The algorithm exploits quantum interference to amplify the global property we care about while suppressing all the local details we don't need.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deutsch's algorithm might seem like a toy problem. After all, who needs to classify single input Boolean functions? But its importance cannot be overstated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First quantum speedup**: It was the first rigorous proof that quantum computers could outperform classical ones, even if just for a contrived problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Template for future algorithms**: The pattern of superposition, oracle, interference, and measurement became the blueprint for more practical algorithms like [Grover's search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) and [Shor's factoring algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conceptual breakthrough**: It showed that quantum computers don't just run faster - they compute fundamentally differently by exploiting interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "As quantum computing pioneer [Umesh Vazirani](https://simons.berkeley.edu/people/umesh-vazirani) noted, Deutsch's algorithm \"opened the door to believing that quantum mechanical effects could be harnessed for computational advantage.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Theory to Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Problem 3, we built the quantum oracles, the black boxes that encode our Boolean functions. Now, in Problem 4, we'll construct the full Deutsch algorithm circuit around these oracles. We'll use [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit), IBM's quantum computing framework, to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build the quantum circuit with Hadamard gates and oracle composition\n",
    "- Run the circuit on quantum simulators\n",
    "- Verify that we correctly determine function type with one query\n",
    "- Visualize the interference patterns that make this possible\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing this ourselves, we'll see firsthand how quantum interference transforms an impossible to improve classical problem into one with a clean quantum solution. We're not just learning about quantum advantage. We're building it with our own code.\n",
