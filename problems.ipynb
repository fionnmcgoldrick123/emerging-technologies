Each function is guaranteed to be either constant (always returns ``False`` or always returns ``True``) or balanced (returns ``True`` for exactly half of the possible input combinations). Write a Python function ``random_constant_balanced`` that returns a randomly chosen function from the set of constant or balanced functions taking four Boolean arguments as inputs."

    "### Background & Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can appreciate what makes the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm remarkable, we need to understand the kind of problem it's actually solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of it all is the [Boolean function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function), a mathematical function that takes one or more ``True``/``False`` inputs and returns a single ``True``/``False`` output. These functions are the building blocks of digital logic and computer circuits. A simple one-input Boolean function might always return ``True`` no matter what you give it, or it might flip its input, returning ``False`` when given ``True`` and vice versa:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def not_function(x):\n",
    "    return not x\n",
    "\n",
    "print(not_function(True))   # Output: False\n",
    "print(not_function(False))  # Output: True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now scale that up to four inputs, and things get more interesting. With four Boolean inputs, there are 2⁴ = 16 possible input combinations, ranging from 0000 to 1111 in binary. A function over four inputs must decide what to return for every single one of those 16 cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm), introduced by [David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1992.0167), narrows its attention to two special categories of such functions. **Constant functions** are the simplest possible case: they ignore their input entirely and always return the same value. For four inputs, only two such functions exist, always ``True`` or always ``False``. **Balanced functions** are more nuanced: they return ``True`` for exactly half the possible inputs and ``False`` for the other half, meaning exactly 8 of those 16 combinations land on each side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does any of this matter? Because determining which category a function belongs to turns out to be a surprisingly powerful test case for quantum computing. Classically, you might need to evaluate the function many times before you can be certain of the answer. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm solves it in a single pass, making it [one of the earliest demonstrations](https://quantum.country/qcvc) that quantum computers can outperform classical ones on a well-defined problem. It's not a practical algorithm in the everyday sense, but it cracked open the door to results like [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) that very much are. Understanding how to generate and work with constant and balanced functions classically is our first step toward appreciating that quantum leap."

    "### Approach & Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to write a Python function that randomly generates either a constant or balanced Boolean function with four inputs. Before writing any code, it's worth thinking carefully about two things: how to *represent* such a function, and how to ensure the randomness satisfies the mathematical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural choice for representation is a lookup table. With four Boolean inputs, there are 2⁴ = 16 possible input combinations, each of which can be expressed as a tuple like ``(True, False, True, False)``. A [Python dictionary](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/) maps each of these 16 tuples to either ``True`` or ``False``, giving us a complete description of the function's behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the data structure settled, the next question is how to populate it. The first step is to randomly decide which type of function to generate, and Python's [``random`` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) makes this easy. A single call to ``random.choice()`` picks between constant and balanced with equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, the two cases diverge. A constant function is the simpler of the two: pick either ``True`` or ``False`` at random, then assign that same value to all 16 input combinations. There's no further constraint to satisfy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A balanced function requires a bit more care. Exactly 8 of the 16 inputs must return ``True`` and the remaining 8 must return ``False``, but which inputs land on which side should be chosen randomly. To do this, we first generate all 16 input combinations using [``itertools.product()``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product), which constructs the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of Boolean values efficiently. Then ``random.sample()`` selects exactly 8 of those combinations without replacement, those become the ``True`` outputs, and the rest become ``False``. This guarantees the balanced property while keeping the selection genuinely random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, rather than returning the dictionary directly, we wrap the lookup in a Python function using a [``def`` statement](https://realpython.com/python-lambda/) that takes four Boolean arguments and returns the corresponding value from the table. This gives us a proper callable that behaves like any other Boolean function and can be passed around and tested in the problems that follow."

    "\n",
    "To really appreciate what this implementation is doing, it helps to step back and think about the landscape it's operating in — and why a quantum computer would care about any of this in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Boolean Function Universe**: When we work with four Boolean inputs, we're standing at the edge of a surprisingly vast space. There are 2^16 = 65,536 different Boolean functions that could exist over those inputs, each one a unique mapping from inputs to outputs. But here's the thing — the [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1992.0167) doesn't care about most of them. It's only interested in two types: the 2 constant functions, and the C(16,8) = 12,870 balanced ones. That's less than 20% of the total, which tells us this algorithm isn't a blunt general-purpose tool. It's a precision instrument, built for a very specific mathematical question. This kind of deliberate narrowing isn't a limitation, it's a feature. As [Sipser (2012)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262018302/) explains in his foundational work on computation theory, many of the most powerful algorithms in [computational complexity theory](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533379/) gain their strength precisely by restricting themselves to problem spaces with special structure. Deutsch-Jozsa is a textbook example of that philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomness in Algorithm Testing**: Of course, building the functions is only half the story, we also need to test them fairly. That's where Python's `random` module comes in, letting us generate constant and balanced functions with equal probability. This uniform distribution might seem like a minor detail, but it matters. A biased sample could quietly skew our results, making one approach look stronger than it really is. The [pseudorandom generation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) is more than adequate for a demonstration like this, though as [Knuth (1997)](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html) points out in *The Art of Computer Programming*, truly rigorous formal analysis would demand randomness sourced from quantum or dedicated hardware, not a software approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Storage Trade-offs**: Once we have our functions, we need somewhere to put them. Representing Boolean functions as lookup tables is a natural choice, it gives us instant O(1) access to any output. But that convenience comes at a cost: O(2^n) storage space. With four inputs, holding 16 key-value pairs feels almost trivial. Scale up even modestly, though, and the picture changes dramatically. [Savage (1998)](https://www.elsevier.com/books/models-of-computation/savage/978-0-12-619851-0) traces these exponential blowups carefully in his models of computation text, painting a clear picture of why storing Boolean functions classically becomes practically impossible as the number of inputs grows. This isn't just an inconvenience, it's a fundamental wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical Verification Costs**: To check whether a function is constant or balanced, our test functions do the only thing classical computation can do: check every possible input, one by one. It's exhaustive, it's guaranteed to be correct, and it's exactly the kind of brute-force approach that reveals why classical computers struggle with this problem. As [Nielsen & Chuang (2010)](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6802309D06B22D27D) show in their landmark quantum computing textbook, in the worst case you have to evaluate at least half the inputs plus one before you can be certain of your answer. There's no shortcut available, you simply have to look.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum Speedup Context**: And that's precisely what makes the [quantum version](https://quantum.country/qcvc) so striking by comparison. A classical computer needs up to 2^(n-1) + 1 function calls to distinguish constant from balanced, nine calls for four inputs. A quantum computer needs exactly one oracle call, regardless of how large the input space grows. That's not a modest improvement; it's an exponential separation. [Bernstein & Vazirani (1997)](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0097539796300921) showed that this gap extends well beyond Deutsch-Jozsa to a whole family of similar problems, establishing it as a genuine and deep property of quantum query complexity rather than a one-off curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Objects and Abstraction**: There's also something worth noticing about the way the code is structured. Each generated function bundles its lookup behaviour together with metadata about what type of function it is. This isn't accidental, it reflects a powerful design philosophy that Python's first-class functions make possible. [Abelson & Sussman (1996)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262510875/) spend considerable time on exactly this kind of abstraction in *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, showing how treating functions as data, objects that can carry information and be passed around — unlocks a level of elegance that would otherwise require far messier solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundations**: Underlying all of this is the formal mathematics of Boolean algebra. A constant function is one where f(x₁,x₂,x₃,x₄) = c for some fixed value c, no matter what the inputs are. A balanced function is one where exactly half the inputs map to True, |{x: f(x) = True}| = 2^(n-1). These definitions, drawn from [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function) and explored thoroughly in [Rosen (2019)](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/discrete-mathematics-applications-rosen/M9781259676512.html), aren't just abstract formalism. They're the precise conditions that make the quantum algorithm possible at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, this classical implementation does something valuable: it makes the problem tangible. It shows us exactly where classical computation hits its limits, and in doing so, explains why researchers started looking elsewhere. As [Preskill (2018)](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2018-08-06-79/) argues in his analysis of the current era of quantum computing, understanding those classical boundaries is the first step toward appreciating what quantum approaches genuinely offer — and why the difference matters."

    "We also need O(2^n) space since we store a complete lookup table mapping each possible input to its output. With four inputs, this means 16 key-value pairs plus some metadata, using roughly 1-2 KB per function. Modern computers handle this easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where It Breaks Down**\n",
    "This approach hits serious problems as input size grows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **8 inputs**: 256 entries (still fine)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Built-in Restrictions**\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Memory Hungry**: The lookup table trades space for speed. For bigger problems, [implicit function representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function#Representation) or [algebraic normal form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_normal_form) would work better.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pseudorandom Only**: We rely on Python's `random` module, which uses the [Mersenne Twister](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.seed) algorithm. For cryptographic work or formal randomness requirements, we'd need a [cryptographically secure random source](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Bottlenecks**\n",
    "A few operations slow things down:\n",
    "- The `random.sample()` call for balanced functions has O(n) complexity and creates a temporary list of all inputs\n",
    "- Dictionary creation computes hash values for tuple keys, though this usually runs very fast\n",
    "- Function call overhead in the returned callable adds small but measurable cost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical vs Quantum Comparison**\n",
    "While generating these functions runs efficiently, figuring out whether an unknown function is constant or balanced classically requires up to 2^(n-1) + 1 function calls. For four inputs, this means up to 9 calls versus the quantum algorithm's single call. That's a 9x speedup. For larger inputs, this gap becomes exponentially huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better Approaches for Larger Problems**\n",
    "When research requires many random functions, more efficient methods include:\n",
    "1. Generating and caching commonly used function types ahead of time\n",
    "2. Using [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) to avoid storing the full lookup table\n",
    "3. Implementing [streaming algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm) when memory gets tight\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current approach prioritizes clarity and correctness over maximum speed. This makes it perfect for educational purposes and small quantum algorithm demos, while clearly showing the computational challenges that motivate quantum computing research."

    "\n",
    "**Question:** [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm) is designed to demonstrate a [potential advantage of quantum computing](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002/) over classical computation. To understand this advantage, we must first understand the classical cost of solving the underlying problem. Write a Python function ``determine_constant_balanced`` that takes as input a function ``f``, as defined in Problem 1. The function should analyze ``f`` and return the string ``\"constant\"`` or ``\"balanced\"`` depending on whether the function is constant or balanced. Write a brief note on the efficiency of your solution. What is the maximum number of times you need to call ``f`` to be 100% certain whether it is constant or balanced?"

    "### Background & Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of determining whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced sits at the heart of understanding [quantum computational advantage](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5). Before we can appreciate what quantum computers offer, we need to understand how classical computers tackle this classification problem and why it proves fundamentally difficult for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Classical Decision Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Boolean function with n inputs, we want to determine its type with absolute certainty. For our four-input functions from Problem 1, there are 2⁴ = 16 possible input combinations. A [constant function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_function) returns the same value for all 16 inputs, while a [balanced function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function) returns ``True`` for exactly 8 inputs and ``False`` for the other 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of the Classical Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Testing if a function is constant or balanced\n",
    "def example_test(f):\n",
    "    first_output = f(False, False, False, False)\n",
    "    second_output = f(False, False, False, True)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if first_output != second_output:\n",
    "        print(\"Function is balanced (different outputs found)\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Need more tests to be certain...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# The problem: finding different outputs proves balanced,\n",
    "# but proving constant requires testing many inputs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worst-Case Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that proving a function is balanced requires finding two inputs that give different outputs, which could happen on the second function call. However, proving a function is constant requires confirming that every possible input returns the same value. In the [worst case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worst-case_complexity), a classical algorithm must evaluate the function at more than half of all possible inputs before it can be certain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For n Boolean inputs:\n",
    "- **Best case**: 2 function calls (find two different outputs immediately)\n",
    "- **Worst case**: 2^(n-1) + 1 function calls (check more than half the inputs)\n",
    "- **For 4 inputs**: Maximum of 9 function calls needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem illustrates a fundamental limitation of classical computation. As [Cleve et al. (1998)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1998.0164) demonstrated, classical computers face an inherent lower bound on query complexity for this decision problem. No clever algorithm or optimization can reduce the worst-case number of queries below 2^(n-1) + 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm) revolutionized our understanding by showing that a quantum computer can solve this same problem with just one function evaluation, regardless of the number of inputs. This represents an exponential speedup: as n grows, classical computers need exponentially more queries while quantum computers need exactly one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Black-Box Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem uses the [oracle model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine) (also called black-box model), where we can only learn about the function by querying it with specific inputs. We cannot inspect its internal structure or implementation. This model allows fair comparison between classical and quantum algorithms since both receive the function as an opaque oracle. As [de Wolf (2019)](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf) explains in his quantum computing lecture notes, query complexity provides a clean framework for demonstrating quantum advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection to Problem 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions generated in Problem 1 serve as perfect test cases for this classical testing algorithm. By constructing functions where we know the ground truth (constant or balanced), we can verify that our classical testing algorithm correctly identifies function types before comparing its performance to quantum approaches in later problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this classical baseline is essential. The effort required to solve this problem classically makes the single-query quantum solution all the more remarkable, demonstrating that [quantum parallelism and interference](https://quantum.country/qcvc) can provide genuine computational advantages over classical approaches."

    "### Approach and Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing a single line of code, it's worth thinking carefully about *what we're actually trying to do* — and what information we'd need to feel confident in our answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Insight**: The key realisation is that we don't need to be exhaustive straight away. If we test two inputs and get two different outputs, we already know the function is balanced, a constant function, by definition, *cannot* produce different outputs. So in the best case, we can reach a conclusion after just two function calls. The harder case is constant functions, where every output looks the same, and we have to keep testing long enough to be sure we're not just getting lucky.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Strategy, Step by Step**: With that in mind, the approach unfolds naturally. We start by generating all 16 possible input combinations for a 4-input Boolean function — every combination from (False, False, False, False) through to (True, True, True, True). Then we walk through them one by one, calling the function on each input and watching what comes back. The moment we see two different outputs, we can stop, we have our answer. If we reach the end without ever seeing a difference, the function is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why the Worst Case is Nine Calls**: The trickiest scenario is the one where we're testing a balanced function but happen to draw inputs from the same half first. A balanced function returns `True` for exactly 8 of the 16 inputs and `False` for the other 8. In the unluckiest possible run, we could test all 8 inputs from one group before finally hitting one from the other, that's 8 calls that all agree, plus 1 that breaks the pattern. So nine calls is the ceiling. If we've made it to nine calls without finding a difference, we can be completely certain the function is constant. Any fewer, and there's still some doubt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What This Tells Us About Classical Computing**: This approach is straightforward, and importantly, it's also *optimal*, no classical algorithm can do better. There's no clever trick that lets you skip inputs or infer the answer earlier. You have to look. That's precisely what makes the [quantum version](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/deutsch-jozsa-algorithm) so remarkable by comparison: it resolves the same question with just a single function call, regardless of how many inputs the function takes. The gulf between nine calls and one isn't just a neat trick, it's a window into something fundamentally different about how quantum computation processes information."

    "### Results and Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "The test suite confirms that our `determine_constant_balanced` function works correctly. The specific test cases verify that hand-crafted constant functions (always-True and always-False) are correctly identified, as well as balanced functions like the first-input function and XOR-all function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comprehensive random testing shows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **100% Accuracy**: All randomly generated functions are correctly classified as either constant or balanced\n",
    "2. **Efficiency Guarantee**: The algorithm never requires more than 9 function calls, confirming our worst-case analysis\n",
    "3. **Early Termination**: For balanced functions, the algorithm often finds differing outputs within just 2-3 calls, demonstrating efficient early stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of function calls needed reveals an important pattern. Constant functions consistently require 9 calls (since we must test more than half the inputs to be certain), while balanced functions typically require far fewer calls because finding two different outputs proves the function is balanced immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates the fundamental asymmetry in the classical approach: proving a function is balanced is easy (find any two different outputs), but proving it's constant requires exhaustive testing of more than half the input space."

    "### Interpretation and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "This classical testing function reveals the fundamental challenge that motivated [Deutsch and Jozsa's quantum algorithm](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1992.0167). By implementing the straightforward classical approach, we can see exactly where classical computation struggles and why quantum methods offer a real advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Asymmetry Problem**: Our algorithm treats constant and balanced functions very differently. Finding that a function is balanced can happen quickly because we just need any two inputs that give different outputs. But proving a function is constant requires us to keep testing until we have checked more than half of all possible inputs. This asymmetry means that constant functions always require the maximum number of queries, while balanced functions usually finish much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon connects to fundamental ideas in [computational complexity](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262018302/). Verifying a property (balanced) through counterexample is often easier than proving a universal property (constant) holds everywhere. [Arora and Barak (2009)](https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/) discuss this distinction in their computational complexity textbook, noting that existential proofs differ fundamentally from universal ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query Complexity and Information Theory**: The number of function calls our algorithm makes relates to [query complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_complexity), which measures how many times we must ask about a function to learn something about it. For the constant vs balanced decision problem, [classical query complexity](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf) has a proven lower bound of 2^(n-1) + 1 queries in the worst case. This is not a limitation of our particular algorithm but rather a fundamental limit that applies to any classical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "[de Wolf (2019)](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qcnotes.pdf) explains in his quantum computing lecture notes that this lower bound comes from information theory. A classical algorithm can only learn one bit of information per function call, and distinguishing between 2 + C(16,8) = 12,872 possible functions requires enough queries to rule out all but one possibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Early Termination Strategy**: Our implementation uses a smart stopping rule. As soon as we see two different output values, we know the function is balanced and stop testing. This optimization dramatically improves average case performance for balanced functions. The test results show that balanced functions often need only 2 or 3 calls to classify, while constant functions always need the full 9 calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "This connects to broader algorithmic principles. [Cormen et al. (2009)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/) describe similar early termination strategies in their algorithms textbook, noting that avoiding unnecessary work often matters more than optimizing individual operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Black Box Constraint**: Our approach treats the function as a [black box or oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine). We cannot look inside to see how it works; we can only test it with specific inputs and observe the outputs. This constraint is essential for fair comparison with quantum algorithms, since both classical and quantum methods receive the function in the same opaque way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle model also matches many real world scenarios. When testing software, we often cannot access source code. When probing physical systems, we can only measure responses to inputs. [Sipser (2012)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262018302/) discusses how oracle complexity provides insights into fundamental computational limits independent of implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Observations**: Running many tests reveals interesting patterns. Constant functions form a smaller portion of the function space (only 2 out of 12,872 possible functions), so when testing random functions, we rarely see constant ones. However, our random generator produces them with 50% probability by design, giving us a balanced test suite. This design choice ensures we thoroughly test both branches of our classification algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection to Quantum Advantage**: The [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) solves this exact problem with just one function call. This exponential speedup from 2^(n-1) + 1 calls down to 1 call represents one of the earliest proven [quantum computational advantages](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5). While the problem itself has limited practical applications, it demonstrates that quantum computers can extract global information about functions more efficiently than any classical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nielsen and Chuang explain in their textbook *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* (2010) that this speedup comes from [quantum parallelism and interference](https://quantum.country/qcvc). A quantum computer evaluates the function on a superposition of all inputs simultaneously, then uses interference to extract the global constant or balanced property without needing to look at individual outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implications**: Although the constant vs balanced problem is artificial, the underlying computational pattern appears in many useful applications. Quantum algorithms for [period finding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm), [database search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm), and [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optimization_algorithms) all exploit similar ideas about extracting global properties from functions efficiently."

    "**Time Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `determine_constant_balanced()` function has different time costs depending on the function type it receives:\n",
    "\n",
    "For constant functions:\n",
    "- We must make exactly 2^(n-1) + 1 = 9 function calls to be certain\n",
    "- Generating all input combinations takes O(2^n) time\n",
    "- Each function call runs in O(1) time assuming the function uses a lookup table\n",
    "- Total: O(2^n) time, which equals O(16) = O(1) for our four input case\n",
    "\n",
    "For balanced functions:\n",
    "- Best case: 2 function calls (first two inputs give different outputs)\n",
    "- Worst case: 9 function calls (first 8 inputs happen to all give the same output)\n",
    "- Average case: roughly O(1) calls since we usually find differences quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight here is that the worst case always involves 9 calls regardless of function type. [Beals et al. (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1145/502090.502097) proved in their quantum query complexity paper that this 2^(n-1) + 1 bound is tight for any deterministic classical algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm uses minimal extra space:\n",
    "- The set `outputs_seen` stores at most 2 Boolean values: O(1) space\n",
    "- The counter variable `calls_made` uses O(1) space  \n",
    "- The list of all inputs from `itertools.product()` takes O(2^n) space\n",
    "\n",
    "Total space complexity is O(2^n) = O(16) for four inputs. Most of this comes from materializing the full list of inputs, though we could reduce this to O(1) by generating inputs on demand instead of storing them all upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maximum Function Calls Needed**\n",
    "\n",
    "For 100% certainty about the function type, we need at most **9 function calls** with four Boolean inputs. Here is why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are 16 possible inputs total\n",
    "2. A balanced function returns True for exactly 8 inputs and False for 8 inputs\n",
    "3. In the absolute worst case, we might test all 8 inputs that give the same output before finding one that gives a different output\n",
    "4. After testing 8 inputs with identical outputs, the 9th input will either:\n",
    "   - Give a different output (proving the function is balanced), or\n",
    "   - Give the same output (but now we have tested more than half, so it must be constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "This 2^(n-1) + 1 formula generalizes to any number of inputs:\n",
    "- 1 input: 2 calls maximum\n",
    "- 2 inputs: 3 calls maximum  \n",
    "- 4 inputs: 9 calls maximum\n",
    "- 8 inputs: 129 calls maximum\n",
    "- 20 inputs: 524,289 calls maximum\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential growth explains why this problem becomes intractable classically for large inputs, while the [quantum solution](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) always needs just one call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of Our Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several constraints affect when and how well this algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed to Four Inputs**: The current implementation only handles functions with exactly four Boolean inputs. Generalizing to arbitrary input sizes would require changing how we generate input combinations and calculate the stopping threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Requires Honest Functions**: We assume the input function is genuinely constant or balanced. If someone provides a function that is neither (returns True for 7 inputs and False for 9 inputs, for example), our algorithm might misclassify it. Adding validation would require testing all inputs, eliminating any efficiency gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assumes Deterministic Functions**: The algorithm expects the function to return the same output every time for a given input. If the function behaves randomly or has side effects that change its outputs, our classification becomes meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Parallelization**: We test inputs one at a time in sequence. While we could theoretically test multiple inputs in parallel, we would still need to wait for at least half the tests to complete before making a decision. Classical parallelism cannot beat the fundamental query complexity bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison with Random Guessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting baseline is random guessing. Since constant functions are extremely rare (only 2 out of 12,872 in our problem space), always guessing \"balanced\" would be right about 99.98% of the time for randomly chosen functions. However, this fails to provide the 100% certainty guarantee that our algorithm delivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Montanaro (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1038/npjqi.2015.23) discusses how query complexity differs from decision accuracy in his survey of quantum algorithms. Having guaranteed correctness matters in applications where wrong answers are costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where Classical Testing Succeeds**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its limitations, the classical approach works well when:\n",
    "- The number of inputs is small (under 10 or so)\n",
    "- We need a simple, understandable algorithm for teaching purposes\n",
    "- We want to verify results from quantum simulations\n",
    "- We lack access to quantum hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "For educational purposes, implementing the classical solution first helps students appreciate exactly what quantum algorithms improve upon. Our test suite demonstrates this by showing the stark difference between the 9 calls needed classically versus the single quantum query."

    "**What Makes Quantum Oracles Different**\n",
    "\n",
    "A [quantum oracle](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/4625/what-exactly-is-an-oracle/4626#4626) is not just a function call-it's a **unitary transformation** that modifies quantum states. Unlike classical functions that destroy the input and produce an output, quantum operations must be [reversible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing) to preserve information.\n",

    "### Results and Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation successfully created quantum oracles for all four single-input Boolean functions. Each oracle was tested against all possible input states and verified to work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Oracle Behavior Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "All four oracles correctly implement the transformation |x⟩|y⟩ -> |x⟩|y ⊕ f(x)⟩, where:\n",
    "- The input qubit (qubit 0) is always preserved\n",
    "- The output qubit (qubit 1) is modified by XORing with f(x)\n",
    "- Each oracle is [reversible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing) - applying it twice returns the original state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constant Functions (f₀ and f₃)**: Both constant oracles behave independently of the input value. For f₀, the output never changes since XORing with 0 has no effect. For f₃, the output always flips because XORing with 1 is equivalent to applying NOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Balanced Functions (f₁ and f₂)**: These oracles produce different outputs depending on the input. The [CNOT gate](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/utility-scale-quantum-computing/bits-gates-and-circuits#cnot-gate) creates this input-dependent behavior by using controlled operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gate Efficiency**: The simplest oracle (f₀) requires no gates at all, while the most complex (f₂) needs three gates. This shows how [quantum circuit design](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/3943/why-is-the-quantum-not-gate-not-sufficient-for-universal-quantum-computation) can vary in complexity even for similar logical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reversibility Verified**: All oracles passed the double-application test. This confirms they are [unitary operations](https://quantum.ibm.com/learning/course/basics-of-quantum-information/single-qubit-gates/quantum-gates), a fundamental requirement for quantum computing operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Demonstration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing input state |10⟩ (x=1, y=0) on each oracle:\n",
    "- **f₀**: |10⟩ -> |10⟩ (no change, since f(1)=0)\n",

    "### Interpretation and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Quantum Oracles Matter**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum oracles are the building blocks that connect classical problems to quantum algorithms. Unlike classical function calls that simply return an output, quantum oracles manipulate superposition states while preserving quantum information. This property is what enables [Deutsch's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm) to solve problems faster than classical approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that these oracles work on multiple possible inputs simultaneously when fed qubits in superposition. This [quantum parallelism](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/6/what-is-quantum-parallelism) is what gives quantum algorithms their power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Patterns Observed**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The XOR Trick**: Using |y ⊕ f(x)⟩ instead of just |f(x)⟩ is not arbitrary - it's the only way to make the operation reversible. Direct computation would destroy information, violating the [unitarity requirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_operator) of quantum mechanics. This technique is used throughout quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Control Inversion**: The f₂ oracle demonstrates a clever trick - wrapping a CNOT gate with X gates inverts when it fires. This pattern appears in many quantum circuits when you need to trigger operations on |0⟩ instead of |1⟩.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ancilla Qubits**: The output qubit acts as an [ancilla](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/6084/what-is-an-ancilla-qubit) - a helper qubit that assists computation. In Deutsch's algorithm, this ancilla will be prepared in a special state to extract global properties through [phase kickback](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/2382/what-is-the-intuition-behind-the-phase-kickback-technique).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical vs Quantum Function Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, determining if a single-input function is constant or balanced requires checking both f(0) and f(1) - that's two queries. But these quantum oracles enable Deutsch's algorithm to answer this question with just one query by exploiting [quantum interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference).\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle doesn't reveal whether the function is constant or balanced directly. Instead, it's used within a larger quantum circuit that creates interference patterns. When the input is in superposition, the oracle acts on all inputs simultaneously, and the subsequent gates extract global information through the way quantum states interfere with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations and Extensions**\n",
    "\n",
    "While these single-input oracles seem simple, they demonstrate principles that scale to larger problems:\n",
    "- The [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) extends this to n-bit functions\n",
    "- [Grover's algorithm](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html) uses oracles to mark solutions in search problems  \n",
    "- [Shor's algorithm](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/guide/shors-factoring-algorithm) uses oracles to implement modular arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge in practical quantum computing is that building oracles for complex functions requires many gates, leading to [decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence). Current [NISQ devices](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/nisq-algorithm) have limited circuit depth, so oracle efficiency matters greatly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "These oracles prove that quantum computers can manipulate classical logic using reversible operations. This addresses a fundamental question in quantum computing: how do we perform irreversible classical computations on a reversible quantum system? The answer is [ancilla qubits and the XOR pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205095), which this problem demonstrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that we can test these oracles on [quantum simulators](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/providers_aer) like AerSimulator is itself remarkable - we're using classical computers to verify quantum operations before running them on real quantum hardware. This simulation capability is essential for developing and debugging quantum algorithms before deploying them on expensive and limited quantum processors."

(1995)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9503016) proved in their foundational paper on elementary quantum gates that at least two qubits are needed to implement any non-trivial function as a reversible oracle, since single-qubit operations can only negate or preserve one bit, not compute a function of a separate input.\n",
    "\n",
    "No ancilla (helper) qubits are required for these single-input oracles. This changes for multi-input oracles - the Deutsch-Jozsa generalization in Problem 5 requires n + 1 qubits for an n-input function. [Aaronson (2013)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/quantum-computing-since-democritus/F77C0E5B2E37A0B05BDE0835E582E41E) discusses in *Quantum Computing Since Democritus* (Chapter 10) how the qubit overhead of oracle construction is a recurring concern in quantum algorithm design.\n",

    "**Gate Optimality**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each oracle uses the minimum number of gates for its function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **f₀**: Zero gates is trivially optimal - the identity function requires no operations.\n",
    "- **f₁**: The CNOT gate directly implements $y \\oplus x$, and since CNOT is itself a primitive gate, one gate is provably minimal for this controlled operation.\n",
    "- **f₃**: A single X gate on the output qubit implements $y \\oplus 1 = \\overline{y}$, which is clearly minimal.\n",
    "- **f₂**: The X-CNOT-X pattern (3 gates) implements an anti-controlled NOT by negating the control qubit. This can be verified as optimal by noting that no single gate or two-gate sequence on 2 qubits can conditionally flip the target when the control is $|0\\rangle$ rather than $|1\\rangle$. [Shende, Markov & Bullock (2004)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0308033) provide a comprehensive treatment of optimal two-qubit circuit synthesis, showing that any two-qubit unitary requires at most three CNOT gates in the general case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulation Overhead**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation uses Qiskit's `AerSimulator` for verification. Simulating quantum circuits on a classical computer has significant overhead:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State vector simulation** requires $O(2^n)$ memory and $O(2^n)$ time per gate, where $n$ is the number of qubits. For our 2-qubit circuits, this is $O(4)$ - trivial.\n",
    "- **Shot-based simulation** (which we use with 1024 shots) adds a multiplicative factor. Each shot samples from the output distribution, so 1024 shots of a 2-qubit circuit run in constant time.\n",
    "- The simulation faithfully reproduces ideal quantum behavior but does **not model noise**, gate errors, or decoherence. [Coles et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3517340) address this gap in their *Quantum Algorithm Implementations for Beginners*, noting that simulator results represent the theoretical upper bound on algorithm performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these small circuits, simulation is instantaneous. However, [Aaronson & Arkhipov (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1145/1993636.1993682) proved that simulating even specific types of quantum circuits becomes classically intractable as qubit count grows, which is the fundamental basis for quantum computational advantage."

    "### Background and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Revolutionary Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1985, physicist [David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch) published a paper that would change how we think about computation. At the time, [quantum computing](https://www.quantum.gov/quantum-computing/) was purely theoretical. No one had built a quantum computer, and many doubted they ever could. Deutsch asked a simple question: *If we could build a quantum computer, would it actually be more powerful than a classical computer?*\n",
    "\n",
    "His answer came in the form of what we now call [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm). It wasn't designed to solve a practical problem. Instead, it was a **proof of concept**. It was a mathematical demonstration that quantum computers could, at least in principle, solve certain problems faster than any classical computer possibly could.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Classical Baseline**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine someone hands you a black box containing one of the four single input Boolean functions from Problem 3. You can query the box by feeding it inputs (0 or 1), and it gives you outputs. Your job is to figure out whether the function inside is constant (always returns the same value) or balanced (returns different values for different inputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classically, this requires two queries**:\n",
    "- First, you ask: What is f(0)?\n",
    "- Then, you ask: What is f(1)?\n",
    "- If both answers are the same, it's constant. If they differ, it's balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's simply no way around it. With classical computation, you must check both inputs to be 100% certain. This is what we demonstrated in Problem 2. The [query complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_complexity) lower bound forces you to make multiple function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Quantum Breakthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deutsch's algorithm solves this same problem with **just one query**. How is this possible? The answer lies in three fundamental quantum phenomena:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Superposition](https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-superposition)**: A quantum bit (qubit) can exist in a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states simultaneously. When we query the oracle, we can feed it both inputs at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[Quantum parallelism](https://quantum.country/qcvc)**: Because the oracle receives a superposition of inputs, it evaluates the function on all possible inputs simultaneously in a single operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **[Interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference)**: After the oracle runs, we use quantum gates to make the different computation paths interfere with each other like waves canceling out or reinforcing. This interference reveals global properties of the function without us ever knowing the individual outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Nielsen and Chuang explain in their textbook [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (2010)](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6AEFFEA52D53BE9AE#overview), this represents a fundamental difference between classical and quantum computation: \"Quantum algorithms can exploit interference to extract global information about a function while learning nothing about individual function values.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Circuit Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deutsch's algorithm uses a carefully choreographed sequence of quantum operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input qubits: |0⟩|1⟩\n",
    "      |\n",
    "   Hadamard  Hadamard  (Create superposition)\n",
    "      |\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step by Step Quantum Magic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through what happens at each stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Initial State**: We start with two qubits in states |0⟩ and |1⟩\n",
    "   - The first qubit (input qubit) starts at |0⟩\n",
    "   - The second qubit (output qubit) starts at |1⟩\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Creating Superposition**: We apply [Hadamard gates](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/single-qubit-gates/common-gates) (H gates) to both qubits\n",
    "   - H transforms |0⟩ into (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2, an equal superposition\n",
    "   - H transforms |1⟩ into (|0⟩ - |1⟩)/√2, an equal superposition with opposite phase\n",
    "   - After this step, our input qubit exists in both |0⟩ and |1⟩ states at once\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Oracle Query**: We apply the oracle from Problem 3\n",
    "   - The oracle evaluates f(x) for **both** x=0 and x=1 simultaneously\n",
    "   - This is quantum parallelism in action. One operation, two evaluations\n",
    "   - The results get encoded in the [quantum phase](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/quantum-phase) (relative sign) of the superposition\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Interference**: We apply another Hadamard gate to the input qubit\n",
    "   - This causes the two computational paths (the x=0 path and x=1 path) to interfere\n",
    "   - If the function is **constant**, the paths interfere **constructively** (reinforce each other) and collapse to |0⟩\n",
    "   - If the function is **balanced**, the paths interfere **destructively** (cancel each other) and collapse to |1⟩\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Measurement**: We measure the input qubit\n",
    "   - If we get 0, the function is constant\n",
    "   - If we get 1, the function is balanced\n",
    "   - We made only **one** oracle call, yet we know the answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Why Interference Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a constant function where f(0) = f(1):\n",
    "- After the oracle, both the x=0 and x=1 computational paths carry the same phase\n",
    "- When we apply the final Hadamard gate, these paths add together (constructive interference)\n",
    "- The result points to the |0⟩ state\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a balanced function where f(0) ≠ f(1):\n",
    "- After the oracle, the x=0 and x=1 paths carry opposite phases\n",
    "- When we apply the final Hadamard gate, these paths subtract (destructive interference)  \n",
    "- The result points to the |1⟩ state\n",
    "\n",
    "As [Cleve et al. (1998)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1998.0164) describe it: \"The algorithm exploits quantum interference to amplify the global property we care about while suppressing all the local details we don't need.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deutsch's algorithm might seem like a toy problem. After all, who needs to classify single input Boolean functions? But its importance cannot be overstated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First quantum speedup**: It was the first rigorous proof that quantum computers could outperform classical ones, even if just for a contrived problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Template for future algorithms**: The pattern of superposition, oracle, interference, and measurement became the blueprint for more practical algorithms like [Grover's search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) and [Shor's factoring algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conceptual breakthrough**: It showed that quantum computers don't just run faster - they compute fundamentally differently by exploiting interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "As quantum computing pioneer [Umesh Vazirani](https://simons.berkeley.edu/people/umesh-vazirani) noted, Deutsch's algorithm \"opened the door to believing that quantum mechanical effects could be harnessed for computational advantage.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Theory to Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Problem 3, we built the quantum oracles, the black boxes that encode our Boolean functions. Now, in Problem 4, we'll construct the full Deutsch algorithm circuit around these oracles. We'll use [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit), IBM's quantum computing framework, to:\n",

    "- Build the quantum circuit with Hadamard gates and oracle composition\n",
    "- Run the circuit on quantum simulators\n",
    "- Verify that we correctly determine function type with one query\n",
    "- Visualize the interference patterns that make this possible\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing this ourselves, we'll see firsthand how quantum interference transforms an impossible to improve classical problem into one with a clean quantum solution. We're not just learning about quantum advantage. We're building it with our own code."

    "### Approach and Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Quantum Circuit Blueprint**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand *why* Deutsch's algorithm works, we need to figure out *how* to build it. The algorithm follows a precise choreography of quantum operations, and translating that into working Qiskit code requires careful planning. Think of it like building a machine: we need to assemble the right components in the right order, test each stage, and verify the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mission is to construct a quantum circuit that takes an oracle from Problem 3 as input and determines whether that oracle implements a constant or balanced function. The circuit structure is deceptively simple, just five stages, but each stage plays a crucial role in making the quantum magic happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 1: Qubit Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by creating a [quantum circuit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit) with the right number of qubits. For Deutsch's algorithm, we need **two quantum registers** and **one classical register**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Qubit 0** (Input qubit): This will hold the superposition of both possible input values (0 and 1)  \n",
    "- **Qubit 1** (Output qubit): This acts as the ancilla that the oracle modifies  \n",
    "- **Classical bit 0**: This stores the measurement result that tells us the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit starts in state |0⟩|0⟩, which represents both qubits in the ground state. But this won't do, we need to prepare a very specific initial configuration before calling the oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll use `QuantumCircuit(2, 1)` to create a circuit with 2 qubits and 1 classical bit. The numbering follows Qiskit's convention where qubit index 0 appears at the **top** of circuit diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 2: The Magic Input State**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where things get interesting. We can't just feed the oracle |0⟩|0⟩ and expect quantum speedup. Instead, we need to prepare the qubits in a carefully crafted state that enables interference:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flip the output qubit**: Apply an X gate to qubit 1, changing |0⟩|0⟩ to |0⟩|1⟩\n",
    "2. **Create superposition**: Apply Hadamard gates to *both* qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "After these operations, our state becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\\\rangle + |1\\\\rangle) \\\\otimes \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\\\rangle - |1\\\\rangle) = \\\\frac{1}{2}(|0\\\\rangle + |1\\\\rangle)(|0\\\\rangle - |1\\\\rangle)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this strange combination? The first qubit is in an equal superposition of both possible inputs - this is the quantum parallelism part. The second qubit is in a superposition with **opposite phases** - this is the key to phase kickback. When the oracle runs, it will encode f(0) and f(1) into the relative phases of the quantum state, and those phases will interfere in the final Hadamard operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll implement this by calling `circuit.x(1)` followed by `circuit.h(0)` and `circuit.h(1)`. The order matters: we must flip the ancilla *before* creating superposition, otherwise the phase relationship won't be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 3: Plugging In the Oracle**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the moment of truth, we query the oracle with our prepared superposition state. Because the input qubit exists in the state |0⟩ + |1⟩, the oracle effectively evaluates f(0) and f(1) **simultaneously**. The results get encoded in the quantum phase rather than in classical bits we could measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the clever part: we built the oracles in Problem 3 as independent `QuantumCircuit` objects. Qiskit allows us to [compose circuits](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#compose) together using the `compose()` method. This means we can take any oracle circuit from Problem 3 and insert it directly into our Deutsch algorithm circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll use `circuit.compose(oracle_circuit, inplace=True)` to append the oracle gates. The `inplace=True` parameter modifies our circuit directly rather than creating a copy, which is more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 4: The Interference Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the oracle runs, we have a superposition that encodes information about f(0) and f(1) in quantum phase. But we can't measure phase directly, we need to convert that phase information into measurable probabilities. This is where the second Hadamard gate on the input qubit works its magic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hadamard gate is self-inverse (applying it twice returns to the original state), but more importantly, it causes quantum states to **interfere**. When we apply H to qubit 0, the |0⟩ and |1⟩ components of the superposition interfere with each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If f(0) = f(1) (constant function), the interference is **constructive** and the qubit collapses to |0⟩\n",
    "- If f(0) ≠ f(1) (balanced function), the interference is **destructive** and the qubit collapses to |1⟩\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because the phases picked up from the oracle cause the probability amplitudes to add (for constant) or subtract (for balanced). It's the quantum equivalent of waves in a pond either reinforcing or canceling each other out.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll implement this with a simple `circuit.h(0)` operation. Just one gate, but it's doing all the heavy lifting of extracting the global function property from the entangled quantum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 5: Measurement and Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is straightforward: measure qubit 0 and read what we get. I'll use `circuit.measure(0, 0)` to measure the input qubit and store the result in classical bit 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurement collapses the quantum state and gives us a definite answer:\n",
    "- **Result = 0**: The function is constant  \n",
    "- **Result = 1**: The function is balanced\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classical randomized algorithms that might sometimes guess wrong, this result is **deterministic**. Run it once, get the right answer every time. That's the power of quantum interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution Strategy: Simulation First**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can run our circuit on real quantum hardware (which is expensive and has limited availability), we need to test it thoroughly. Qiskit provides the [AerSimulator](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-aer/stubs/qiskit_aer.AerSimulator.html), a classical quantum simulator that perfectly emulates ideal quantum behavior without noise or decoherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "My testing approach:\n",
    "1. Build the Deutsch circuit for each of the four oracles from Problem 3\n",
    "2. Run each circuit on the AerSimulator with 1024 shots (measurement repetitions)  \n",
    "3. Verify that constant functions (f₀ and f₃) always produce measurement result 0\n",
    "4. Verify that balanced functions (f₁ and f₂) always produce measurement result 1\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll use `AerSimulator()` to create the simulator instance, `transpile(circuit, simulator)` to optimize the circuit for the simulator backend, and `simulator.run(circuit, shots=1024).result()` to execute and retrieve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1024 shots aren't strictly necessary since the algorithm is deterministic, in theory, one shot would suffice. But running multiple shots helps us verify consistency and catch any implementation bugs that might cause non-deterministic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization for Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the circuit structure clear, I'll visualize each complete circuit using Qiskit's [circuit drawing capabilities](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#draw). The `circuit.draw('mpl')` method creates a matplotlib figure showing:\n",

    "- The oracle gates in the middle  \n",
    "- The final Hadamard and measurement\n",

    "**Demonstrating the One-Query Advantage**\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial insight to verify is that we're only calling the oracle **once**. Each complete circuit contains exactly one instance of the oracle gates, yet it determines whether the function is constant or balanced with 100% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasize this, I'll add a counter or annotation showing how many times we query the oracle. This makes the quantum advantage concrete: where Problem 2's classical approach needed 2 queries to be certain, we now need just 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "The oracles we built in Problem 3 were designed specifically to work with this algorithm. Their reversible |x⟩|y⟩ -> |x⟩|y ⊕ f(x)⟩ structure is what enables the phase kickback effect that makes Deutsch's algorithm work. When the output qubit is in the |0⟩ - |1⟩ state, applying the oracle causes the *input* qubit to pick up a phase that depends on f(x). That's information flowing backward through the circuit, a purely quantum phenomenon with no classical analog.\n",
    "\n",
    "This backward information flow is why quantum computing can be so counterintuitive. We're not just computing faster; we're computing in a fundamentally different way that exploits quantum mechanical effects like superposition, entanglement, and interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Simple to General**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Deutsch's algorithm only handles single-input functions, implementing it properly sets us up for Problem 5, where we'll tackle the [Deutsch-Jozsa generalization](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) with four-input functions. The same five-stage pattern (initialize, prepare, oracle, interfere, measure) will apply, just with more qubits and more complex oracle circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the beauty of quantum algorithms, once you understand the basic principles, they scale naturally to larger problems. The hard part is wrapping your head around the quantum weirdness the first time."

The circuit begins by carefully preparing the qubits, setting up the right quantum state for interference. When I apply the oracle, the quantum system encodes the function’s behavior into the phase of the qubits. The final Hadamard gate mixes everything together, and the measurement step reveals the answer. If the result is zero, the function is constant. If the result is one, the function is balanced. This process shows how quantum computing can solve certain problems in a single step, where classical methods would need more work. The narrative of the circuit flows naturally from preparation, through the oracle, to interference and measurement, making the logic clear and easy to follow."

    "\n",
    "**Question:** The [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) generalizes Deutsch's approach to functions with several input bits. Use [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) to create a quantum circuit that can handle the four-bit functions generated in Problem 1. Explain how the classical function is encoded as a quantum oracle, and demonstrate the use of your circuit on both of the constant functions and any two balanced functions of your choosing. Show that the circuit correctly identifies the type of each function."

    "### Background & Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**From One Bit to Many**\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems 3 and 4 gave us something remarkable: a quantum circuit that determines whether a single-input Boolean function is constant or balanced using just one oracle query, where any classical approach requires two. That result is clean and satisfying, but it leaves an obvious question hanging in the air. Single-input functions are a toy. In Problem 1, we were already working with functions that take four Boolean inputs, producing 16 possible input combinations and a function space containing over twelve thousand balanced possibilities. What happens when we try to apply the same quantum trick to functions at that scale?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer arrived in 1992, when [David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1992.0167) published their generalisation of the original algorithm. Rather than restricting themselves to functions with one input bit, they considered functions of the form $f: \\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$, where $n$ can be any positive integer. The function still must be either constant or balanced in the same sense: returning the same output for every input, or returning 1 for exactly half the possible inputs and 0 for the other half. But now the input space has grown from 2 possibilities to $2^n$, and the classical cost of deciding between those two cases grows with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Classical Wall**\n",
    "\n",
    "With a single input, a classical algorithm needs at most two queries to be certain. With $n$ inputs, the classical requirement becomes $2^{n-1} + 1$ queries in the worst case. This is not a weakness of any particular algorithm but a fundamental limit proven by [Beals, Buhrman, Cleve, Mosca and de Wolf (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1145/502090.502097): no deterministic classical strategy can do better. For four inputs, as in our problem, that means up to nine queries, which is exactly what we measured in Problem 2. For twenty inputs it would mean over half a million. The classical cost grows exponentially as the number of input bits increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is straightforward. A classical algorithm can only ask one question at a time, and each query reveals the output for a single input. To rule out the possibility that a function is constant, you have to test more than half the inputs because a function that agrees on exactly half its inputs could still be balanced. You only become certain once you have seen more inputs give the same value than a balanced function would allow. That threshold is $2^{n-1} + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Quantum Answer Stays Constant**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm answers this question with exactly one oracle query, regardless of $n$. Whether the function takes 1 input bit or 1,000, the quantum circuit consults the oracle once and returns the correct classification every time. As [Nielsen and Chuang (2010)](https://www.academia.edu/41154803/Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information_by_Nielsen_and_Chuang) describe it, this is an exponential separation between classical and quantum query complexity for a well-defined computational problem, not a clever trick but a provable mathematical fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism is the same as Deutsch's original algorithm scaled up. Instead of placing a single qubit in superposition before querying the oracle, we place all $n$ input qubits in superposition simultaneously. Applying a [Hadamard gate](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/hadamard/) to an individual qubit in the $|0\\rangle$ state produces an equal superposition of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. When we apply Hadamard gates to all $n$ input qubits at once, the result is an equal superposition of all $2^n$ possible input combinations simultaneously. In our four-input case, that is all sixteen inputs from 0000 to 1111, all present in the quantum state at the same moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the Oracle Sees**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the oracle is applied to this superposition, it does not evaluate the function once. It effectively evaluates the function on every possible input in parallel, encoding the results into the quantum phases of the state. This is the quantum parallelism that [Cleve, Ekert, Macchiavello and Mosca (1998)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1998.0164) formalised as the key property distinguishing quantum query algorithms from their classical counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle itself follows the same reversible construction from Problem 3, the transformation $|x\\rangle|y\\rangle \\rightarrow |x\\rangle|y \\oplus f(x)\\rangle$, but now $x$ is an $n$-bit string rather than a single bit. To build this oracle for our four-bit functions we need to encode the function's truth table into a quantum circuit that can act on superpositions. This encoding is what Problem 1 was quietly preparing us for: having a precise, enumerated lookup table for every possible input combination is exactly the information the oracle construction requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interference at Scale**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the oracle runs, a final round of Hadamard gates is applied to all $n$ input qubits. Just as a single Hadamard gate created constructive or destructive interference for the one-bit case, $n$ Hadamard gates create interference across the entire $2^n$ dimensional space of the quantum state. The mathematics of this step, worked out carefully by [Deutsch and Jozsa (1992)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1992.0167) and later presented more clearly by Cleve et al., shows that when the function is constant, all that interference adds up constructively to produce the all-zeros bit string $|00...0\\rangle$ with certainty. When the function is balanced, the interference is destructive for the all-zeros outcome, meaning we will measure something other than all zeros with certainty. The measurement outcome directly reveals the function type, and we have only called the oracle once to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Circuit We Need to Build**\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling from Problem 4 to Problem 5 means scaling the circuit from two qubits to $n + 1$ qubits, where the extra qubit is the ancilla output qubit that enables phase kickback. For our four-input functions, the circuit will use five qubits in total: four input qubits and one output ancilla. The preparation step applies an X gate to the ancilla followed by Hadamard gates on all five qubits. The oracle sits in the middle, encoding the function, and a final set of Hadamard gates on the four input qubits precedes the measurement. It is the same five-stage structure from Deutsch's algorithm, just broader.\n",
    "\n",
    "The oracle construction for a four-bit function is more involved than for a single-bit function. We have sixteen possible inputs to account for, and balanced functions can distribute their outputs in $\\binom{16}{8} = 12{,}870$ distinct ways. [Aaronson (2013)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/2487754) notes in *Quantum Computing Since Democritus* that oracle construction is where the theoretical elegance of quantum algorithms meets the practical complexity of circuit design. The function's truth table must be translated into a reversible circuit using gates that [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) can execute, a process that typically involves multi-controlled NOT gates to flip the ancilla qubit for each input combination that produces a 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Problem Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is not a practically useful computation in the everyday sense. Nobody needs an exponentially fast method for classifying artificial Boolean functions. Its significance lies in what it proves. It was the first algorithm to demonstrate a provable exponential quantum speedup over classical computation, and it did so in a setting clean enough to admit a full mathematical proof rather than a conjecture. As [Preskill (2018)](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2018-08-06-79) reflects in his survey of the quantum computing landscape, Deutsch-Jozsa established the conceptual template that later algorithms like [Shor's factoring algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1137/S0097539795293172) and [Grover's search](https://doi.org/10.1145/237814.237866) would go on to apply to genuinely useful problems. The pattern of superposition, oracle query, and interference extraction recurs throughout quantum algorithm design, and this problem is where we implement it at the scale it was originally intended for.\n"
