# Emerging Technologies Assessment Classical and Quantum Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of classical and quantum algorithms, focusing on the [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa) and its predecessor, [Deutsch's algorithm](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm). The [problems.ipynb](problems.ipynb) notebook demonstrates the fundamental differences between classical and quantum approaches to determining whether [Boolean functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function) are constant or balanced, showcasing one of the earliest proven quantum computational advantages.

The notebook progresses through five interconnected problems that build understanding from classical function generation to full quantum algorithm implementation. Beginning with Python-based classical solutions, it transitions to quantum circuit design using [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit), ultimately demonstrating how quantum computers can solve certain problems exponentially faster than their classical counterparts. Each problem includes detailed theoretical background, implementation code, comprehensive testing, and analysis of efficiency and limitations.
